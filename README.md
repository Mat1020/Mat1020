# What's up? ðŸ‘‹ I'm MatÃ­as TajÃ¡n.

Iâ€™m very passionate about Computer Science, especially Machine Learning! I love Raspberry Pi and its community, and Iâ€™m excited to be part of it, too.
I enjoy programming in my free time, creating cool projects, and exploring software development. Iâ€™m eager to learn how to build websites and develop video games.

Iâ€™m always open to collaborating on projects, as long as theyâ€™re not too intenseâ€”Iâ€™m a young male teen with school and other commitments.

I was born in Caracas, Venezuela ðŸ‡»ðŸ‡ª, so Spanish is my first language. However, donâ€™t worryâ€”I already have a strong grasp of English!
