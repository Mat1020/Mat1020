# What's up? ðŸ‘‹ I'm MatÃ­as TajÃ¡n.

I'm very interested in Computer Science, especially in Machine Learning. I love Raspberry Pi and its community; I want to be part of it, too. <br>
I also like to do software; I like to program in my free time and make cool projects. I'm looking forward learning how to make Websites and Video Games.

I'm always going to say yes to collaborate on a project; as long as it's not intense since I'm a young male teen, so I've school and other stuff going on.

I was born on Venezuela ðŸ‡»ðŸ‡ª, Caracas. So, yeah, English is not my first language; it's Spanish. But don't worry, I already know a lot of English.
