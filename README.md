# What's up? I'm MatÃ­as TajÃ¡n ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m very passionate about Computer Science and Engineering! I love Raspberry Pi and its community, and Iâ€™m excited to be part of the community, too.
I enjoy programming in my free time, creating and developing cool projects, and exploring software development. Iâ€™m eager to learn how to build websites and develop video games.

Iâ€™d be happy to collaborating and developing on your projects, and happy to help you through any of mine. I'm a guy ("He", "His", "Him") currently in school.

I was born in Caracas, Venezuela ðŸ‡»ðŸ‡ª, so Spanish is my first language. However, donâ€™t worryâ€”I already have a strong grasp of English!
