# What's up? ðŸ‘‹

Hi, my name is MatÃ­as, and Iâ€™m very passionate about Robotics Engineering and Computer Science. I love Raspberry Pi and its community, and Iâ€™m excited to be part of the community, too.
I enjoy programming in my free time, creating and developing cool projects, and exploring software development--Iâ€™m eager to learn how to build websites and develop video games.

Iâ€™d be happy to collaborating and developing on your projects, and happy to help you through any of mine. 

I'm a guy ("He", "His", "Him") currently in a student. I was born in Caracas, Venezuela ðŸ‡»ðŸ‡ª in Souht America.
